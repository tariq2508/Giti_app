# Introduction

The Personal Music Streamer App API enables secure, private, and seamless music streaming from a user's own NAS or server to iOS, Android, and Web clients.

## Key Principles
- **Direct NAS/Server Access:** No third-party cloud storage; all music remains on the user's device or NAS.
- **Protocols:** SMB (for Synology and compatible NAS), HTTP/HTTPS for streaming, with future extensibility for WebDAV, SFTP, etc.
- **Security:** All credentials and sensitive data are encrypted and never leave the user's device.
- **Cross-Platform:** Consistent endpoints and behaviors for mobile and web clients.

This documentation provides detailed API references for each functional area of the app.
