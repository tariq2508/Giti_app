# User Journey 10: Error Handling & Reconnection

## Conceptual Image
A modal dialog over a white screen, with a rounded card and a red warning icon. The error message is in dark text, with a green “Retry” button and a blue “Help” link below. The background is dimmed with a light blue overlay. The UI remains clean and friendly, with rounded corners and soft shadows.

## Overview
This journey describes how the app handles errors (e.g., network issues, authentication failures) and guides the user through reconnection or recovery steps.

## Step-by-Step Flow
1. **Detect Error**
   - App detects an error (e.g., lost connection, failed authentication, playback error).
2. **Notify User**
   - App displays a clear, actionable error message (e.g., banner, dialog, notification).
3. **Provide Recovery Options**
   - User is offered options to retry, update credentials, or check network settings.
4. **Attempt Reconnection**
   - App attempts to reconnect automatically or after user action.
5. **Success or Escalation**
   - If reconnection succeeds, user resumes normal activity.
   - If not, app provides further guidance (e.g., help links, contact support).

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
- **Persistent Failure:**
  - Offer troubleshooting steps and allow user to exit or try again later.
- **Multiple Errors:**
  - Queue or group errors to avoid overwhelming the user.
- **Silent Failures:**
  - Log errors for debugging even if not shown to the user.

## Developer Notes
- Centralize error handling logic for consistency.
- Use user-friendly language in all error messages.
- Provide actionable recovery steps for each error type.
- Log all errors with sufficient context (but no sensitive info).
- Ensure UI remains responsive during error states and recovery attempts.
