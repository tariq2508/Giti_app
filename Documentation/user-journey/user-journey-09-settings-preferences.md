# User Journey 09: Settings & Preferences

## Conceptual Image
A settings screen with a white background and a list of options (theme, streaming quality, notifications) in rounded cards. Each card has a blue icon and a green toggle or dropdown. The “Reset to Defaults” button is outlined in green. The app bar is light blue.

## Overview
This journey describes how a user customizes app settings and preferences, such as theme, streaming quality, and notification options.

1. **Access Settings**
   - User navigates to the 'Settings' section from the main menu or profile.
2. **View & Edit Preferences**
   - User sees a list of configurable options (e.g., theme, streaming quality, notifications).
   - User toggles switches, selects options, or enters values as needed.
3. **Save Changes**
   - Changes are saved automatically or via a 'Save' button.
4. **Reset to Defaults**
   - User can reset preferences to default values.

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
- **Invalid Input:**
  - Validate user input and show errors for invalid values.
- **Save Failure:**
  - Notify user if preferences cannot be saved (e.g., storage issue).
- **Unsupported Options:**
  - Hide or disable options not supported on the current platform.

## Developer Notes
- Store preferences persistently (local storage or cloud sync if supported).
- Modularize settings logic for easy addition of new options.
- Ensure UI is clear, accessible, and provides feedback for changes.
- Log errors for debugging but do not expose technical details to users.
