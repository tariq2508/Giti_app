# Personal Music Streamer App

## Vision
Empower users to stream their personal music collections from anywhere, on any device, while maintaining full privacy and control over their media. The app is designed to be open source and free, providing a seamless, cross-platform experience for music lovers who want to connect directly to their own servers or NAS devices.

## Goals
- **Universal Access:** Enable users to access and stream their music libraries from their personal NAS or server, regardless of location or device.
- **Privacy & Ownership:** Ensure users retain complete ownership and privacy of their music files, with no third-party data collection or cloud storage.
- **Cross-Platform Experience:** Deliver a consistent and high-quality user experience on iOS, Android, and Web platforms.
- **Background & Lock Screen Playback:** Support uninterrupted listening, even when the app is minimized or the device is locked.
- **Open Source & Free:** Foster a community-driven, transparent, and accessible project for all users.

## Purpose
This app is built for users who want to:
- Stream music directly from their own NAS or personal server (with initial focus on Synology and SMB protocol)
- Avoid reliance on commercial cloud music services
- Enjoy their music library with advanced playback controls, playlist management, and car integrations (CarPlay/Android Auto)
